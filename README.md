# 🏡 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains multiple housing-related features such as area, number of rooms, location indicators, and other factors that influence property value.  
All steps—from data cleaning to model evaluation—are implemented inside the Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Overview

The notebook covers the full end-to-end ML workflow:

- Importing and exploring the dataset  
- Handling missing data  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Feature scaling (if applicable)  
- Model training (Linear Regression / RandomForest / etc.)  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Visualizing correlations and feature importance

**📈 Results**

The notebook outputs:

- Cleaned and transformed dataset

- Trained prediction model for house prices

- Evaluation metrics such as:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- R² score

- Visualizations including:

- Feature correlations

- Distribution plots

- Model prediction vs. actual values

**These results help understand the factors that most influence real-estate pricing.**
